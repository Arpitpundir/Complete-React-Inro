/*The import plugin helps ESLint catch commons bugs around imports, exports, and modules in general
jsx-a11y catches many bugs around accessibility that can accidentally arise using React, like not having an alt attribute on an img tag.
react is mostly common React things, like making sure you import React anywhere you use React.
babel-lint allows ESLint to use the same transpiling library, Babel, that Parcel uses under the hood. Without it, ESLint can't understand JSX.
eslint-plugin-react now requires you to inform of it what version of React you're using. We're telling it here to look at the package.json to figure it out.*/
